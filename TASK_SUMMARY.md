# Task Summary: Binary-Integrated Classification Model

## Task Overview
The task was to integrate two LLM models to build a new model pipeline:
1. A binary model (`ntnu-smil/Phi-4-mm_Binary_QA_NI_0415_1964`) that predicts pass/fail (0/1) with confidence
2. A classification model (`ntnu-smil/Phi-4-multimodal-instruct_QA_NoImage_0325_1964`) that predicts detailed scores (1-5)

## Implementation

We created a complete pipeline with the following components:

1. **Binary Model Evaluation Script (`evaluate_binary_data.py`)**
   - Loads and runs the binary model on our training datasets
   - Captures predictions in the format "0,0.80" or "1,0.85"
   - Saves predictions to JSON files for later use

2. **Binary-Integrated Classification Model (`fine-tune-lttc-binary.py`)**
   - Created a new version of the fine-tuning script specifically for this task
   - Implemented a custom `BinaryIntegratedDataset` class that:
     - Loads the binary model predictions
     - Integrates them into the prompt for the classification model
     - Adds guidance to the model about how to interpret the binary signal

3. **Modified Instruction Prompt**
   - Added explicit instructions to the classification model about using binary predictions:
   ```
   "When the binary output is 0, the actual score should probably be between 1-3.
    When the binary output is 1, the actual score should probably be between 4-5."
   ```
   - Formatted binary predictions into the prompt: "Binary model prediction: 0,0.80"

4. **Pipeline Execution Script (`run_binary_integrated_pipeline.sh`)**
   - Created a shell script that runs the entire pipeline end-to-end
   - Handles both datasets with their respective form_ids (1764 and 1964)
   - Automatically passes binary prediction paths between scripts

5. **Documentation (`README_BINARY_INTEGRATED.md`)**
   - Detailed explanation of how the pipeline works
   - Usage instructions for running the pipeline
   - Implementation details and architecture explanation

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved Consistency**: By using binary model predictions as a guide, the classification model can produce more consistent outputs following the guidance (scores 1-3 for binary=0, scores 4-5 for binary=1).

2. **Model Specialization**: Each model focuses on what it does best - binary model provides a clear pass/fail signal, while the classification model provides fine-grained scoring with that context.

3. **No Binary Model Training Required**: The approach only requires training the classification model, making it more efficient.

4. **Flexible Integration**: The binary model's output is treated as a guide rather than a strict constraint, allowing the classification model to make the final decision.

## Execution

To execute the entire pipeline, one simply needs to run:
```bash
./run_binary_integrated_pipeline.sh
```

This will:
1. Run binary model evaluation on both datasets
2. Train the classification model on both datasets with binary integration
3. Save the models to their respective output directories
